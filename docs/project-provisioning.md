# Draft: New endpoint for project provisioning

## Motivation
The Talentech Evaluation API is used to offer customers (users) an integrated experience between Talentech's application tracking systems (ATS) and the customer's preferred vendor of reference checks and assessment tests (partner). It offers a two way integration where the recruiter can trigger an invitation to a reference check or assessment test in their ATS and get the results back into the ATS. 

To improve the user experience, it is desired to let the partner be notified about new recruitment projects in the ATS before the first invitation is triggered. It's also desired to let the ATS user easily edit the project specific template by allow the user to navigate from the ATS to the partner UI.


## Suggested solution

### Project provisioning endpoint

Endpoint description

### Partner template editing

URL

Optional Talentech ID SSO
